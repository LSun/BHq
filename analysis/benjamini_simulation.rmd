## Simulate correlated $N(0, 1)$ variables

Suppose $Z = \left[Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_n\right]' \sim N\left(0, \Sigma\right)$, where $\Sigma_{ii} \equiv 1$. In this experiment, $\Sigma$ is simulated in the following way.

- Simulate $B_{n \times d}$ where $B_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, 1)$, $n = 10^4, d = 5$.
```{r, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(1995)
n <- 1e4
d <- 5
B <- matrix(rnorm(n * d), n, d)
```

- Calculate $\Sigma = D^{-1/2}\left(BB^T + I\right)D^{-1/2}$, where $D = \text{diag}\left(BB^T + I\right)$
```{r, cache = TRUE}
Sigma <- cov2cor(B %*% t(B) + diag(n))
## The first 5 rows and columns of Sigma
Sigma[1 : 5, 1 : 5]
```

- Fix $\Sigma$ and simulate $Z \sim N\left(0, \Sigma\right)$ $m = 10^3$ times.
```{r, cache = TRUE}
m <- 1000
## An equivalent fast way to simulate Z
## Z is a n * m matrix
## Each column of Z is a realization
normalize.constant <- sqrt(rowSums(B^2) + 1)
Z <- replicate(m, 
  (colSums(t(B) * rnorm(d)) + rnorm(n)) / normalize.constant
)
```

## Inflation, deflation, and in-between

- Simulated in this way, all elements in one $Z$ are marginally $N\left(0, 1\right)$ (hence they are *null* $z$-scores), and highly correlated.

- In addition, even with exactly the same $\Sigma$, the empirical distribution of each realizations $z = \left[z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n\right]$ of $Z$ can be inflated, deflated, or in-between, defined in the following way. Let $\text{sd}$ be the sample standard deviation of $z$.
    - Inflated Noise: $\text{sd}(z) > 1.05$
    - Deflated Noise: $\text{sd}(z) < 0.95$
    - In-between: $0.95 \le \text{sd}(z) \le 1.05$
The cutoffs are thus chosen so as to when $z$ are $n$ iid $N(0, 1)$ samples, it would be highly unlikely to have $\text{sd}(z)$ falling into the inflated or deflated categories.

- Categorize our $m$ realizations of $Z$ into the three groups mentioned above.
```{r}
## Categorize m realizations into three groups
sd.Z <- apply(Z, 2, sd)
group <- cut(sd.Z, breaks = c(0, 0.95, 1.05, Inf), labels = c("Deflated Noise", "In-between", "Inflated Noise"))
table(group)
```

- Examples: the blue line is the density curve of $N(0, 1)$.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
def.exp <- Z[, order(sd.Z, decreasing = F)[10]]
inb.exp <- Z[, which.min(abs(sd.Z - 1))]
inf.exp <- Z[, order(sd.Z, decreasing = T)[10]]
cor.exp <- cbind.data.frame(Z = c(def.exp, inb.exp, inf.exp), Noise = rep(c("Deflated Noise", "In-Between", "Inflated Noise"), each = n))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = cor.exp, aes(Z)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)
                 #, breaks = 100
                 ) +
  facet_wrap(~Noise) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, col = "blue")
```

## Add signals and obtain $p$-values for every simulation trial.

- In each of our simulation trial, the signals are simulated as $\theta_j \overset{iid}{\sim} 0.9\delta_0 + 0.1N(0, 4^2)$, $j = 1, \ldots, n$.
```{r}
theta <- replicate(m, sample(c(rep(0, n * 0.9), rnorm(n * 0.1, 0, 4))))
```

- Observations $X_j = \theta_j + Z_j$.
```{r}
X <- theta + Z
```

- $z$-scores $= X_j / 1 = X_j$, two-sided $p$-values $= 2\Phi\left(-\left|X_j\right|\right)$.
```{r}
p <- 2 * pnorm(-abs(X))
```

## Apply $\text{BH}_q$ and form a rejection set at the nominal FDR $= 0.1$ for each trial.

```{r}
q <- 0.1
p.BH <- apply(p, 2, p.adjust, method = "BH")
BH.rej <- apply(p.BH, 2, function(x){x <= q})
```

## Calculate FDP for each trial

```{r}
FDP.fun <- function (rej.id, theta) {
  sum(theta[rej.id] == 0) / max(1, length(theta[rej.id]))
}
FDP <- sapply(seq(m), function(i){FDP.fun(BH.rej[, i], theta[, i])})
```

## Average FDP for each group and overall

```{r}
## Boxplot of FDP for each group
boxplot(FDP ~ group, ylab = "FDP")
abline(h = q, lty = 2, col = "red")
points(1 : 3, tapply(FDP, group, mean), col = "blue", pch = 13)
## Mean of FDP for each group
tapply(FDP, group, mean)
## sd of FDP for each group
tapply(FDP, group, sd)
## 95% CI of the mean of FDP for each group
tapply(FDP, group, function(x){t.test(x)$conf.int})
## 95% CI of the mean of FDP overall
t.test(FDP)$conf.int
```

## Observations

- "Inflated Noise" is a particularly hostile group for $\text{BH}_q$, and indeed it's hostile for all multiple testing procedures which ignore the correlation.

- That said, $\text{BH}_q$ are still, maybe surprisingly so to many, quite robust to correlation in two senses.
    - First, with a given $\Sigma$ containing substantial off-diagonal correlations, $\text{BH}_q$ manages to control FDR on average, over all inflated, deflated, and in-between put together.
    - Second, even for the particularly hostile "Inflated Noise" group, $\text{BH}_q$ gives an average FDP $=$ `r signif(mean(FDP[group == "Inflated Noise"]), 3)` at a nominal FDR $= 0.1$, which is quite impressive, much better than other methods like `qvalue`.

- The most relevant issue for $\text{BH}_q$ on correlated data is not controlling the mean of FDP, but rather the variability of FDP for different data sets. Like many methods ignoring correlation, $\text{BH}_q$ is too conservative when the noise is deflated, and too anti-conservative when the noise is inflated. However, in practice we would prefer a robust procedure that gives a rejection set with an FDP close to the desired nominal FDR, conditioned on every given data set. This is what we want to achieve with `CASH`.

- The surprising relative robustness of $\text{BH}_q$ might be theoretically explained by the Gaussian derivatives theory on correlation we used in `CASH`, which I'd like to explore further.
